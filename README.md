# Random-Spinner
A tiny utility Playground I made (in &lt;10 minutes) during my WWDC17 trip

## Story
Yeah so on the last day of WWDC17 everyone on our floor (all 16 years old back then I believe) got together and stayed up the whole night socializing and playing games together. 

Some activities that we were doing required spinning a bottle to "randomly" choose a person. I thought that using a bottle was inefficient and not random enough, so I wrote this. 

Sadly they didn't want to use it.
